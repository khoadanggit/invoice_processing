Invoice process automation: Automatically extract information from invoice and save it to spreadsheet
Instead of having to read the invoice and manually enter in the contents of the invoice (the sum, sender's name, invoice date,...), with this automation the information in pdf file of the invoice is extracted and entered into spreadsheet software of your choice! Less work for you and less chance of human error. In my workflow, I've opted for Airtable in order to also save the original copy of the invoice along with its information. 

After the invoice is saved, a mail is automatically send to controlling team to approve if the invoice is correct. 

The best part is this is a very cost efficient system that every small business can use. If your business need help to set up this system, please reach out to me.
